Implement an UI with the default Python UI Tkinter, mapping the command line parameters to the UI elemnents.

the --verbose and other debug parameters should NOT have a UI equivalent and once activated should prrint to the console and not to the UI

The UI should be started with the --gui paranmeters

Once terminated, the app should show a messagebox with a friendly message.
